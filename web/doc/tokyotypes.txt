  --`op' specifies an operation type: 
  --`TDBQCSTREQ' for string which is equal to the expression, 
  --`TDBQCSTRINC' for string which is included in the expression, 
  --`TDBQCSTRBW' for string which begins with the expression, 
  --`TDBQCSTREW' for string which ends with the expression, 
  --`TDBQCSTRAND' for string which includes all tokens in the expression, 
  --`TDBQCSTROR' for string which includes at least one token in the expression, 
  --`TDBQCSTROREQ' for string which is equal to at least one token in the expression, 
  --`TDBQCSTRRX' for string which matches regular expressions of the expression, 
  --`TDBQCNUMEQ' for number which is equal to the expression, 
  --`TDBQCNUMGT' for number which is greater than the expression, 
  --`TDBQCNUMGE' for number which is greater than or equal to the expression, 
  --`TDBQCNUMLT' for number which is less than the expression, 
  --`TDBQCNUMLE' for number which is less than or equal to the expression, 
  --`TDBQCNUMBT' for number which is between two tokens of the expression, 
  --`TDBQCNUMOREQ' for number which is equal to at least one token in the expression, 
  --`TDBQCFTSPH' for full-text search with the phrase of the expression, 
  --`TDBQCFTSAND' for full-text search with all tokens in the expression, 
  --`TDBQCFTSOR' for full-text search with at least one token in the expression, 
  --`TDBQCFTSEX' for full-text search with the compound expression. 
  -- All operations can be flagged by bitwise-or: `TDBQCNEGATE' for negation, `TDBQCNOIDX' for using no index.
