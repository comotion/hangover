What to do and how:

 * parse audio metadata into the db
 * get_next: random tagged audio
  - get_next knows about silences, metadata, can queue songs
  - get_next knows about shows
 * get_end: increment played
 * get_meta: metadata for current song
  - metadata switchover
  - metadata 2 PAD
 * get_program: what is playing, when?
 * ls: next (song, metadata, timecode)
  - ls<->hangover<->irc

interface coding:
  search -> playlist builder
         -> selector builder -> example playlist -> "realized playlist"
