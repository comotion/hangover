What to do and how:

  - get_next:
    knows about silences, metadata, can queue songs
    knows about shows & jingles
    knows playtime, repeat count and can warn
 * get_end: increment played
 * get_meta: metadata for current song
  - metadata switchover
  - metadata 2 PAD
 * get_program: what is playing, when?
 * ls: next (song, metadata, timecode)
  - ls<->hangover<->irc

interface coding:
  create program {name= time= endtime= owner=}
  search tracks
     -> track tagger/editor
     -> 

     -> playlist builder
     -> selector builder -> example playlist -> "realized playlist"
               ^
     program builder \
               ||     live show scheduler
               ||
  schedule display
